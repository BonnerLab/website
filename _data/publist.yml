- title: "TUTORIAL: A High-Dimensional View of Neuroscience."
  image: mick_ccn.png
  description: With technological advances allowing us to capture neural responses to thousands of stimuli across numerous channels (e.g., human fMRI, mouse two-photon imaging, monkey neuropixel probes), we face the challenge of analyzing vast, costly datasets. We must consider which computational tools are best suited for high-dimensional neural representation studies and what theoretical insights we can derive about neural representations from these large-scale datasets.

- title: "High-performing neural network models of visual cortex benefit from high latent dimensionality"
  image: high_dimensionality.png
  description: Investigating deep neural networks (DNNs) as models for the visual cortex, we found that higher-dimensional representations in these networks better predict cortical responses and improve learning of new stimuli, challenging the idea that lower dimensionality enhances performance. This indicates that high-dimensional geometries might be advantageous for DNN models of visual processing.

- title: "Contextual coherence increases perceived numerosity independent of semantic content."
  image: context_coherence.png
  description: Characterizing visual features that systematically bias our numerosity perception promises to uncover the processes that form ANS representations. Recent work demonstrated that reducing coherence of low-level visual attributes such as color and orientation systematically reduces perceived numerosity. Here we ask whether the coherence effect is exclusive to low-level visual features or instead whether it can be driven by higher-level features.

- title: Hierarchical organization of social action features along the lateral visual pathway
  authors: Emalie McMahon, Michael F. Bonner, Leyla Isik
  image: social_action_features.png
  description: The lateral stream's organization, thought to be hierarchical like in the ventral and dorsal streams, has not been thoroughly studied for naturalistic, social visuals. We compiled 250 3-second videos of everyday interactions between two people, annotated for visual features from low-level to high-level, including scene properties, social dynamics, and emotional content.

- title: Perceived Distance Alters Memory for Scene Boundaries

  description: What factors determine when visual memories will include details that go beyond perceptual experience? Here, seven experiments (N = 1,100 adults) explored whether spatial scale-specifically, perceived viewing distance-drives boundary extension. We created fake miniatures by exploiting tilt shift, a photographic effect that selectively reduces perceived distance while preserving other scene properties (e.g., making a distant railway appear like a model train). We found that visual memory is modulated by the spatial scale at which the environment is viewed.

- title: Object representations in the human brain reflect the co-occurrence statistics of vision and language
  authors: Michael F. Bonner, Russell Epstein
  image: obj_to_vec.png
  description: Using machine learning and fMRI, we tested if the human visual system encodes object co-occurrence statistics, revealed through individual object perception. We identified low-dimensional representations of these statistics in real-world scenes and correlated them with voxel-wise fMRI responses during object viewing. Our findings indicate cortical responses to single objects are influenced by their typical statistical contexts, highlighting brain regions where this connection is strongest.
