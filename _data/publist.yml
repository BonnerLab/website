  description: Advances in technology enable us to record neural responses to many thousands of stimuli from a huge number of channels (e.g. fMRI in humans, two-photon imaging in mice, neuropixel probes in monkeys). Given the unprecedented scale of these data – collected with incredible effort at enormous expense – what computational tools can we use to study neural representations in high dimensions? What theoretical insights can we gain about the nature of neural representations from large-scale datasets?

- title: "Contextual coherence increases perceived numerosity independent of semantic content."
  image: context_coherence.png
  description: Characterizing visual features that systematically bias our numerosity perception promises to uncover the processes that form ANS representations. Recent work demonstrated that reducing coherence of low-level visual attributes such as color and orientation systematically reduces perceived numerosity. Here we ask whether the coherence effect is exclusive to low-level visual features or instead whether it can be driven by higher-level features.

- title: "High-performing neural network models of visual cortex benefit from high latent dimensionality"
  image: high_dimensionality.png
  description: Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction—neural networks with highdimensional image subspaces tended to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. Moreover, we found that high dimensionality was associated with better performance when learning new categories of stimuli, suggesting that higher dimensional representations are better suited to generalize beyond their training domains.
