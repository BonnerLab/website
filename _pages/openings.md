Our lab prioritizes creating a diverse and inclusive environment, embracing scientists from all genders, races, sexual orientations, and backgrounds. We strive to be a supportive community, aiming to recruit individuals who will contribute to sustaining a nurturing and productive atmosphere.

### PostDocs
**We are recruiting a postdoctoral fellow** to work on scientific explorations at the interface of computational neuroscience and machine learning at Johns Hopkins University. The fellow will join a collaborative team led by Profs Mick Bonner (dept of Cognitive Science) and Brice MÃ©nard (dept of Physics) investigating the fundamental principles that govern neural representations in high dimensions, with a focus on vision.
Applicants should have a PhD in neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, computer science, engineering, or related disciplines, with some expertise in scientific programming and statistical analyses. Specific expertise in computational neuroscience and/or machine learning is a plus. 

To apply or learn more about the position, send an email to [mfbonner@jhu.edu](mailto:mfbonner@jhu.edu).

### Graduate students
**We are actively seeking graduate students** to join our lab in Fall 2024, as part of the [**Cognitive Science PhD and MA program**](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/graduate/). When applying, please specify Mick as a preferred advisor. While Mick welcomes inquiries and is available for questions via email, he typically does not conduct meetings or interviews prior to the application review process. We recommend familiarizing yourself with our lab's recent publications to gain insights into our research focus. If you believe your interests align with our lab's endeavors, ensure to highlight this alignment in your application.

Additionally, we offer an [application mentoring program](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/event/phd-application-mentoring-2/) spearheaded by our current students, designed to guide prospective PhD students through the application process. Exploring collaborations within our department is encouraged; Mick is open to both co-advising and acting as a secondary advisor, reflecting our department's collaborative spirit. We invite you to also consider our diverse faculty team in your application.
