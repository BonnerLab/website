# Open positions

**We are currently open for PhD and postdoc applications..**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of biological vision perception, often at the interface of deep learning and computational neuroscience. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:mfbonner@jhu.edu). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group.


### Master projects for Hopkins students
If you are a Master student at Hopkins looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Cognitive Science MA degree at Hopkins, see [ma.cogsci.jhu](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/graduate/ma-program/). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
